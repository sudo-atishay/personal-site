# Clean Software and Simple Tools

I've been drawn more and more toward software that feels fast, focused, and does only what it needs to.  
There's something refreshing about using tools that just **launch instantly** and **get out of your way**.

Modern apps often chase features, animations, or heavy frameworks that add very little value but make everything feel slower.  
But there's a quiet charm in using clean, lightweight sites and tools that respect your time and attention.

Here are some examples of sites that represent that simplicity well:

- [d-rens.xyz](https://d-rens.xyz)  
- [Sam Altman's Blog](https://blog.samaltman.com/)  
- [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev)  
- [JV Scholz](https://jvscholz.com)  
- [btxx.org](https://btxx.org)  
- [unrealapex.srht.site](https://unrealapex.srht.site)  
- [Write.as](https://write.as)  
- [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog)  
- [Orodu.net](https://orodu.net)  
- [Michael Stapelberg](https://michael.stapelberg.ch)  
- [Julien Danjou](https://julien.danjou.info)  
- [Mgree](https://mgree.github.io)  
- [Melody Codes](https://melody.codes)  
- [Reik Das](https://reikdas.github.io)  
- [Angel Hof](https://angelhof.github.io)  
- [Mustardfox](https://mustardfox.org)  
- [Ezri Zhu](https://ezrizhu.com)

They all share a kind of quiet confidence — no noise, no ads, no tracking, no distractions.  
Just content, presented beautifully and quickly. It's the kind of web that feels alive, but peaceful.

We need more of this. Software that loads fast, feels human, and doesn't demand more than it gives.
