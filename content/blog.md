## Clean Software and Simple Tools

I’ve been drawn more and more toward software that feels fast, focused, and does only what it needs to.  
There’s something refreshing about using tools that just **launch instantly** and **get out of your way**.

Modern apps often chase features, animations, or heavy frameworks that add very little value but make everything feel slower.  
But there’s a quiet charm in using clean, lightweight sites and tools that respect your time and attention.

Here are some examples of sites that represent that simplicity well:

- [d-rens.xyz](https://d-rens.xyz)  
- [Sam Altman’s Blog](https://blog.samaltman.com/)  
- [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev)  
- [JV Scholz](https://jvscholz.com)  
- [btxx.org](https://btxx.org)  
- [unrealapex.srht.site](https://unrealapex.srht.site)  
- [Write.as](https://write.as)  
- [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog)  
- [Orodu.net](https://orodu.net)  
- [Michael Stapelberg](https://michael.stapelberg.ch)  
- [Julien Danjou](https://julien.danjou.info)  
- [Mgree](https://mgree.github.io)  
- [Melody Codes](https://melody.codes)  
- [Reik Das](https://reikdas.github.io)  
- [Angel Hof](https://angelhof.github.io)  
- [Mustardfox](https://mustardfox.org)  
- [Ezri Zhu](https://ezrizhu.com)

They all share a kind of quiet confidence — no noise, no ads, no tracking, no distractions.  
Just content, presented beautifully and quickly. It’s the kind of web that feels alive, but peaceful.

We need more of this. Software that loads fast, feels human, and doesn’t demand more than it gives.

## Why Everyone Should Write

Writing is one of the best ways to think clearly.  
In a world filled with fast scrolling, writing slows you down just enough to understand what you actually think.

You don’t need to be a professional writer. You just need to start.  
A small post about what you’re learning, what you built, or what’s been on your mind — that’s enough.

Blogging is a quiet reflection of your thoughts, a record of how you grow and change over time.  
It’s not about going viral. It’s about creating your own small corner of the internet that feels honest.

Tools like [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev) make it easy to start without friction — no signups, no clutter, just words.  
Even a single Markdown file like this one can be your blog.

If you work in tech, writing helps you **clarify your ideas**, **share what you learn**, and **build a genuine voice**.  
The modern web moves fast, but writing gives you a moment to pause — and that pause is valuable.

*That’s all for now. Build simple things, write often, and keep your web light.*
